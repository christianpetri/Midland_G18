## Corrected Information

No, you cannot.

There are two primary reasons why you can't listen to the 462.6875 MHz frequency on your Midland G18 radio in Switzerland:

1. **Technical Limitation**: The Midland G18 is specifically designed as a PMR446 radio. It operates exclusively within the 446.0 to 446.2 MHz frequency range, in compliance with European regulations. It does not have the capability to tune into frequencies outside this limited range, such as 462.6875 MHz.

2. **Broadcast Restrictions**: The 462.6875 MHz frequency is allocated to the FRS (Family Radio Service) band, which is used for two-way radio communication in North America. In Switzerland and the rest of Europe, this frequency is not designated for public communication, and there are no weather broadcasts or other standardized transmissions available on it.
