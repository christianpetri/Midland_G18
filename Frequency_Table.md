## Corrected Information

No, you cannot.

There are two primary reasons why you can't listen to the 462.6875 MHz frequency on your Midland G18 radio in Switzerland:

1. **Technical Limitation**: The Midland G18 is a PMR446 radio. It is designed to operate exclusively on the frequencies within the 446.0 to 446.2 MHz band. It is not a wideband scanner and cannot be tuned to listen to frequencies outside of its designated operating range.

2. **No Broadcasts**: The frequency 462.6875 MHz is part of the FRS (Family Radio Service) band, which is used for two-way radio communication in North America. There are no weather broadcasts or any other standardized radio transmissions on this frequency in Switzerland or anywhere else in Europe.
