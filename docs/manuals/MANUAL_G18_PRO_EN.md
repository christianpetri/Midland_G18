### Power on/off and volume adjustment

Rotate the PWR/VOL clockwise to turn the radio on.
Rotate the control clockwise /counter-clockwise to adjust the volume level as you
prefer.
To turn the radio off, rotate the control counter-clockwise till hearing a mechanical
“click”.

### Transmission and reception

To communicate, all radios in your group must be set to the same channel.
Briefly press the Function key 1 to enable the Monitor feature in order to make sure
that the frequency is not busy, then press the PTT button.
Release the PTT key to receive.
*Only one user at a time can talk during radio communications. Therefore, it is important*
*not to transmit when you are receiving a communication and use the transmission mode*
*sparingly to allow other users to talk.*
*Transmission consumes a significant amount of energy and should therefore be used*
*sparingly to prolong the battery life.*
*If you are unable to contact a station that you have no problems in receiving, the station*
*may be using CTCSS tones or DCS codes.*

### Monitor

The Monitor feature is for excluding (opening) the Squelch, in order to listen to
signals that are too weak to keep the Squelch permanently opened.
Press briefly the Function key 1 to enable such function.

### Roger Beep (end transmission tone)

When the PTT button is released, the radio will beep to confirm to other users that
you’ve finished your transmission and that they can start talking.
Roger Beep is disabled by default and can be activated through the programming
software.

### Alarm function (Emergency)

By pressing the Emergency button, the radio will switch to Alarm Emergency
mode.
G18 PRO will switch to transmission for 30 seconds by generating a sound alarm,
then for further 30 seconds will remain in tx to allow the user to communicate his
status.
At the end, the radio will switch to reception.
If needed, the Emergency call can be repeated.
*Note: this function can be activated through the optional programming software.*

Here below is a list of the default functions that you will find in the menu of this
radio.
First of all, you have to push the MENU button to enter and find the desired function.

### Scan

This function is enabled by pushing the Function key 2 for 3 seconds; you will see
the channels scanning on the display of the radio.
Whenever any signal is detected, the scanning will stop on a busy channel.
As soon as the signal is no longer detected, the scan will start after 5 seconds.
If you press the PTT, the radio will transmit on the latest busy channel; after about
5 seconds that you released the PTT, the scanning will be active.

### PRI (Priority Scan)

When you activate this function, the radio will alternately scan the standard channels and the priority one. The priority channel can be selected only with the programming software. The default priority channel is CH1.

### VOX

The VOX feature enables hands free conversations without using PTT: just speak
in the direction of the microphone and the communication will be automatically
activated.
The VOX sensitivity can be adjusted in 10 different levels (0,1,2,3…9) through the
Menu or programming software :
OFF means that the VOX is turned off, level 1 is set by default and has the lowest
VOX sensitivity, 9 is the highest one.
To activate the VOX levels, follow these steps:

1. Press the MENU button;
2. Turn the Encoder knob until the display shows “VOX”;
3. Press the ENT key;
4. Turn again the Encoder knob and select the desired VOX level: 1= low sensitivity; 9= highest sensitivity.
