### Coverage/Range

The maximum range depends on terrain condition and is obtained during use in an
open space.
The only limitation to maximum possible range are environmental factors such as
blockage caused by trees, buildings or other obstructions. Inside a car or a metallic
construction, the range can be reduced. Normally the coverage in the city, with buildings or other obstructions is about 1 or 2 Km. In open space but with obstructions
like trees, leaves or houses the maximum possible range is about 4-6 Km. In open
space, without obstructions and in sight, like for example in mountain, the coverage
can be more than 12 Km.

### Suggestions and warnings

Your G18 PRO was designed to fulfill any warranty obligations and to enjoy this
product for many years.
As for all the electronic devices, we recommend you to follow these suggestions:

- Do not attempt to open the unit. Non-expert handling of the unit may damage
it and annul the warranty.
- When using regulated power supply, take note of the power voltage, that must
be between 6V and 8V to avoid damages.
- High temperatures can shorten the life of electronic devices, and warp or melt
certain plastics. Do not store the radio in dirty areas.

## Battery recharge

G18 PRO is equipped for using a 7,4V Li-ion rechargeable battery pack, which can
be recharged by connecting the socket of the AC/DC wall adaptor to a mains power socket and inserting the jack of the wall adaptor into the desktop charger plug.
It takes 4 hours to fully recharge the radio.
The led of the desktop charger indicates the status of the recharge:
Red = charging,
Green = full charge
For maximum battery life, we recommend you to charge the battery pack when the
G18 PRO is off and the battery pack is fully discharged.
! Using a different battery charger other than the one specified can cause damage
to your device or may even cause explosions and personal injuries.
_The Battery power saving feature enables a reduction in consumption of up to 50% and_
_saves the battery life. If it has been set, it automatically activates when the transceiver_
_does not receive any signal for more than 5 seconds. Power saving can be disabled only_
_through the Programming software._

## Operations

### Power on/off and volume adjustment

Rotate the PWR/VOL clockwise to turn the radio on.
Rotate the control clockwise /counter-clockwise to adjust the volume level as you
prefer.
To turn the radio off, rotate the control counter-clockwise till hearing a mechanical
“click”.

### Transmission and reception

To communicate, all radios in your group must be set to the same channel.
Briefly press the Function key 1 to enable the Monitor feature in order to make sure
that the frequency is not busy, then press the PTT button.
Release the PTT key to receive.
_Only one user at a time can talk during radio communications. Therefore, it is important_
_not to transmit when you are receiving a communication and use the transmission mode_
_sparingly to allow other users to talk._
_Transmission consumes a significant amount of energy and should therefore be used_
_sparingly to prolong the battery life._
_If you are unable to contact a station that you have no problems in receiving, the station_
_may be using CTCSS tones or DCS codes._

### Monitor

The Monitor feature is for excluding (opening) the Squelch, in order to listen to
signals that are too weak to keep the Squelch permanently opened.
Press briefly the Function key 1 to enable such function.

### Roger Beep (end transmission tone)

When the PTT button is released, the radio will beep to confirm to other users that
you’ve finished your transmission and that they can start talking.
Roger Beep is disabled by default and can be activated through the programming
software.

### Alarm function (Emergency)

By pressing the Emergency button, the radio will switch to Alarm Emergency
mode.
G18 PRO will switch to transmission for 30 seconds by generating a sound alarm,
then for further 30 seconds will remain in tx to allow the user to communicate his
status.
At the end, the radio will switch to reception.
If needed, the Emergency call can be repeated.
_Note: this function can be activated through the optional programming software._

## MENU functions

Here below is a list of the default functions that you will find in the menu of this
radio.
First of all, you have to push the MENU button to enter and find the desired function.

### Scan

This function is enabled by pushing the Function key 2 for 3 seconds; you will see
the channels scanning on the display of the radio.
Whenever any signal is detected, the scanning will stop on a busy channel.
As soon as the signal is no longer detected, the scan will start after 5 seconds.
If you press the PTT, the radio will transmit on the latest busy channel; after about
5 seconds that you released the PTT, the scanning will be active.

### PRI (Priority Scan)

When you activate this function, the radio will alternately scan the standard channels and the priority one. The priority channel can be selected only with the programming software. The default priority channel is CH1.

### VOX

The VOX feature enables hands free conversations without using PTT: just speak
in the direction of the microphone and the communication will be automatically
activated.
The VOX sensitivity can be adjusted in 10 different levels (0,1,2,3…9) through the
Menu or programming software :
OFF means that the VOX is turned off, level 1 is set by default and has the lowest
VOX sensitivity, 9 is the highest one.
To activate the VOX levels, follow these steps:

1. Press the MENU button;
2. Turn the Encoder knob until the display shows “VOX”;
3. Press the ENT key;
4. Turn again the Encoder knob and select the desired VOX level: 1= low sensitivity; 9= highest sensitivity.

### Squelch

The Squelch function suppresses noises on free channels and allows to receive even
weak signals.
G18 PRO has 10 (0-9) different Squelch levels that can be set by programming
software or Menu:
0 means that the Squelch is turned off; from level 1 to level 9 you will have different
levels of noise reduction. The higher is the level, the louder will be the Squelch.
By default, the Squelch level is set on level 5.
To select the Squelch level:

1. Press the MENU button;
2. Turn the Encoder knob until “SQL” is displayed;
3. Press the ENT button;
4. Turn the Encoder knob and select the desired Squelch level (the levels available are 10);
5. Confirm your selection with ENT.
Make sure you do not set an excessively high squelch level because in this case you
may not be able to receive weaker signals. On the other hand an excessively low
Squelch value could enable the Squelch even when no signals are present.
Squelch must always be adjusted when no signals are present.

### Scrambler

The scrambler is designed to protect communications.
This feature prevents parties from other networks from hearing and understanding
voice communications.
